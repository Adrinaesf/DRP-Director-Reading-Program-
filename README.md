# 📘 Directed Reading Program (Winter 2025)

This repository documents my experience in the **Directed Reading Program (DRP)** offered by **Women in Mathematics** at the **University of Waterloo** during the Winter 2025 term.

## 🔍 Overview

I was selected as one of only **36 students** from all undergraduate years in the Faculty of Mathematics, chosen through a competitive application process with **hundreds of applicants**.

- 📚 Topic: *Introduction to Algebraic Geometry* (pure mathematics)
- 👥 Group: 4 students + 1 graduate mentor
- 📆 Term: January 2025 – April 2025

## 💡 What I Did

- Studied the textbook *Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms* by Cox, Little, and O'Shea  
- Learned the fundamentals of **algebraic geometry**, focusing on **Gröbner bases**, **polynomial ideals**, and **Buchberger’s algorithm**
- Implemented a SageMath script that solves a **4×4 Sudoku** puzzle using **Gröbner basis techniques**
- Explored how systems of polynomial equations can be translated into logic puzzles and solved algebraically
- Delivered a final presentation to an audience of over **50 people**, including professors, PhD students, and undergraduate peers  
- Received a formal **certificate of completion**

## 🧠 Skills Gained

- Deepened understanding of abstract algebra and computational algebraic geometry  
- Gained experience with symbolic computation and **SageMath**  
- Practiced collaborative and independent mathematical learning  
- Improved technical communication through presenting complex mathematical ideas clearly
